                 My name is Tanner Millican. I am 24 years old and from Eastland, Texas. I have a wife and 3 cats. Making all
            sorts of art is probably one of my favorite things to do. I also really enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons. (I'm
            really new to it, I've only been in a couple campaigns.) Before starting this adventure into web development, I
            worked as a field technician on POS systems for Allsup's. I've got one younger brother and three older brothers.
            I dream to one day be able to travel as much and as far as I want without any worries. I hope to achieve this
            through becoming a web developer and hopefully landing a remote position.
